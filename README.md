# LEDMatrix Official Plugins Registry

üéâ **Complete Plugin Ecosystem** - Official plugin registry for [LEDMatrix](https://github.com/ChuckBuilds/LEDMatrix).

> **‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT:** As of October 2025, all plugins have been migrated to **individual repositories** for better version management. See [PLUGIN_MIGRATION_NOTICE.md](PLUGIN_MIGRATION_NOTICE.md) for details.

## üöÄ What's New

**REPOSITORY MIGRATION COMPLETE!** All 18 LEDMatrix plugins are now in individual GitHub repositories, each with independent versioning and release cycles. The plugin store (`plugins.json`) has been updated to point to the new repositories.

üìñ See individual plugin repositories for detailed setup instructions and to contribute.
