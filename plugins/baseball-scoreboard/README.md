## Background Service

The plugin uses background data fetching for efficient API calls:

- Requests timeout after 30 seconds (configurable)
- Up to 3 retries for failed requests
- Priority level 2 (medium priority)

## Data Source

Game data is fetched from ESPN's public API endpoints for all supported baseball leagues.

## Dependencies

This plugin requires the main LEDMatrix installation and inherits functionality from the Baseball base classes.

## Installation

1. Copy this plugin directory to your `ledmatrix-plugins/plugins/` folder
2. Ensure the plugin is enabled in your LEDMatrix configuration
3. Configure your favorite teams and display preferences
4. Restart LEDMatrix to load the new plugin

## Troubleshooting

- **No games showing**: Check if leagues are enabled and API endpoints are accessible
- **Missing team logos**: Ensure team logo files exist in your assets/sports/ directory
- **Slow updates**: Adjust the update interval in league configuration
- **API errors**: Check your internet connection and ESPN API availability
