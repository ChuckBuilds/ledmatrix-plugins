# Changelog

## [1.30.1] - 2026-09-11

### Fixed
- **Live score updates now actually reach the scrolling strip.**
  1.41.0 added the rebuild-on-change machinery but wired it in the wrong order,
  which left it inert: the rebuild decision is computed by fingerprinting the
  live managers' cached games, and the only call that refreshed those managers
  (_ensure_manager_updated) sat INSIDE the block that decision gates. So once
  the first strip was built nothing refreshed the data, the fingerprint could
  never change, and the block never ran again -- the same frozen-until-restart
  symptom the previous release set out to fix. Switch mode was never affected
  because _try_manager_display() refreshes unconditionally on every pass; scroll
  mode now gets the same guarantee, refreshing the live managers before it
  fingerprints them. _ensure_manager_updated() is itself interval-guarded, so on
  frames where no refresh is due this costs two getattrs and a comparison.
  Ported across all eight scoreboards in one change, per CLAUDE.md non-
  negotiable #7, and pinned by a test that asserts the ordering structurally --
  reversing the two lines leaves every behavioural test passing while the panel
  silently freezes.

## [1.30.0] - 2026-09-10

### Fixed
- **Live games now reach the scrolling strip mid-cycle.**
  The strip was rendered once per scroll cycle and _scroll_prepared was cleared
  only when the cycle completed, so a score changed while the marquee was
  running stayed frozen in the pixels until it finished -- minutes, for a long
  game list. Restarting the display forced a rebuild, which is the workaround
  users were finding. The strip is now rebuilt when anything the card draws
  changes, keeping scroll_position and total_distance_scrolled so the marquee
  does not snap back to the start and the cycle still completes on schedule. The
  game clock deliberately does not trigger a rebuild -- it ticks every second
  and re-rendering every card that often is the whole frame budget on a Pi --
  and rebuilds are floored at 5s so a large slate cannot thrash. Ported across
  all eight scoreboards in one change, per CLAUDE.md non-negotiable #7. Rebuild
  frequency is self-limiting: the floor between rebuilds scales with what the
  last one actually cost, so the marquee never spends more than about 5% of its
  time frozen re-rendering. Measured on a Pi 4, a strip rebuild takes 29ms for
  one game and 463ms for fifteen; a fixed floor would have been fine for the
  first and wrong for the second. Also fixes the rebuild-cost bookkeeping being
  keyed differently from where it is read, which left the duty-cycle cap inert
  in most plugins.
## [1.29.7] - 2026-09-11

### Fixed
- **Placeholder team logos draw their abbreviation at PressStart2P 16, not 12.**
  That face is crisp only at multiples of 8; 12 was anti-aliased, and 16 is the
  nearest crisp size for the 64px logo tile. Panel text was already on-grid via
  `_FONT_PIXEL_GRID` and is unchanged.

## [1.24.3] - 2026-09-01

### Fixed
- **Recent games now get their odds.** `SportsUpcoming` fetches odds for the games that survive selection and `SportsLive` fetches them per included game — the Recent screen never fetched them at all, so its "odds if available" renderer never had anything attached and every final rendered bare. `update()` now fetches odds for the selected finals, exactly as Upcoming does; ESPN keeps a completed game's closing line on the same endpoint, so a final is as answerable as an upcoming game. Same fix as football-scoreboard 2.29.3 — which only surfaced there because football's display-path rotation attached odds to rotated-in finals by accident; this plugin has no such rotation, so its finals were bare in every configuration. Pinned by `test_recent_games_get_odds.py`.
