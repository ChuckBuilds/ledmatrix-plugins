# Changelog

## [1.26.0] - 2026-09-11

### Added
- **Style each card separately.** Font, size, colour and position for the
  score, clock, team abbreviation, status, detail, odds and ranking can now
  differ between the live, upcoming and recent cards. Set them under
  "Per-Mode Overrides" in the plugin's settings; anything left blank follows
  the settings above it, so a single change applies to one card and leaves
  the others alone.

  Existing configs are unaffected: with no per-mode overrides set, every card
  renders exactly as before -- verified against the golden images at all
  eight panel sizes.

## [1.20.3] - 2026-09-01

### Fixed
- **Recent games now get their odds.** `SportsUpcoming` fetches odds for the games that survive selection and `SportsLive` fetches them per included game — the Recent screen never fetched them at all, so its "odds if available" renderer never had anything attached and every final rendered bare. `update()` now fetches odds for the selected finals, exactly as Upcoming does; ESPN keeps a completed game's closing line on the same endpoint, so a final is as answerable as an upcoming game. Same fix as football-scoreboard 2.29.3 — which only surfaced there because football's display-path rotation attached odds to rotated-in finals by accident; this plugin has no such rotation, so its finals were bare in every configuration. Pinned by `test_recent_games_get_odds.py`.
