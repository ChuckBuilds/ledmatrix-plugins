# Changelog

## [2.17.0] - 2026-08-29

### Changed
- **The score is now the headline it was always meant to be.** It was the only element on the card not sized from the panel, and it was not even bigger than its neighbours: PressStart2P renders crisply on an 8px grid, so the 10px default snapped to 8 -- the same 8 the clock above it and the game date below it are drawn at. It is now sized from `display_height`, snapped to its face's pixel grid, and capped at twice its design size; the clock/date face is regrown the same way but held a grid step below it. A 192x48 or 128x64 panel goes from an 8px score to 16px. The cap is the same one football's adaptive layout settled on: 24px needs a 128px gap and buys mostly dead space, while 16px doubles the score and costs almost no logo.
- **Score and date positions scale with their faces.** The bottom-anchored score's `-14`, the centred score's `-3`, and the date's 7px drop were all chosen for an 8px face and clipped a grown one off the card.
- **Logos are capped by the score's centre reserve.** The scorebug sized them to 1.5x the panel *width* -- 288px on a 192-wide panel -- with nothing reserving the centre, so a wide mark ran most of the way in from both sides and the score was drawn on top of it. Each logo now reaches inward only as far as the edge of the score's gap, plus the 2px it is already bled outward by.
- Byte-identical to the previous release at 64x32, 128x32, 256x32 and 96x48 — the logo cap applies only where the score actually grew. 128x64, 192x48, 256x64, 256x128 and 384x96 take a 16px score.

## [2.6.0] - 2026-08-04

### Changed
- **Scroll display now runs on the core's shared implementation.** The orchestration half of `scroll_display.py` — scroll-helper configuration, frame pumping, completion, settings resolution, and native `global_config['target_fps']` support — moves to the core's `src.common.sports_scroll` (LEDMatrix 3.2.0). Only the soccer-specific content half stays here: game cards and league separator icons.
- **Nothing changes on an older core.** The import is guarded: a core without `src.common.sports_scroll` falls back to `scroll_display_legacy.py` and the plugin behaves exactly as it did. The minimum core version is unchanged at 2.0.0 — the plugin does not *require* 3.2.0, it merely prefers it.
- This lineage's scroll settings are preserved explicitly, since they differ from the shared defaults: a 24px gap rather than 48, `min_duration`/`max_duration` bounds of 30/300 (core's own default max is 600), and game cards pinned at 128px where core sizes them to the panel.
- Three unused methods (`_get_scroll_speed`, `get_scroll_duration`, `has_content`) are not carried over — nothing called them. A redundant `set_scroll_speed()` call is also gone: the previous code set it twice, once in px/s and again in px/frame, and only the second took effect.
- Verified byte-for-byte: all 24 safety-harness renders (8 panel sizes × 3 screens) are identical to 2.5.2.

## [2.5.0] - 2026-07-29

### Fixed
- **TEAMS.md listed wrong team codes**: the documented abbreviations had drifted
  from ESPN's, so following the docs produced a silently empty display. Manchester
  United was listed as `MUN` (ESPN uses `MAN`), Manchester City as `MCI` (`MNC`),
  Real Madrid as `RM` (`RMA`), and Ligue 1 had eight wrong codes including Lyon
  and Marseille. Several rosters were also a season out of date. Every table is
  now generated from ESPN's live team endpoints and verified against them.

### Added
- **A reason when a league shows nothing.** An empty screen had two very
  different causes that looked identical in the logs. Now, once per league:
  an unrecognised favorite team logs a warning naming the closest match
  (`favorite team 'MUN' is not a Premier League team code. Closest match is
  'MAN' (Manchester United).`), while codes that are correct but have no
  fixtures yet log the date the season starts, stating that an empty display
  until then is expected rather than a misconfiguration.
- **Cross-league code clashes documented.** Favourites match by abbreviation
  across every enabled league, and `MUN` is Bayern Munich in the Bundesliga —
  so the old docs could have matched the wrong club entirely. TEAMS.md now
  lists the codes that mean different clubs in different leagues.
