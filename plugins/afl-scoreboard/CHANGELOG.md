## [1.17.3] - 2026-09-01

### Fixed
- **Recent games now get their odds.** `SportsUpcoming` fetches odds for the games that survive selection and `SportsLive` fetches them per included game — the Recent screen never fetched them at all, so its "odds if available" renderer never had anything attached and every final rendered bare. `update()` now fetches odds for the selected finals, exactly as Upcoming does; ESPN keeps a completed game's closing line on the same endpoint, so a final is as answerable as an upcoming game. Same fix as football-scoreboard 2.29.3 — which only surfaced there because football's display-path rotation attached odds to rotated-in finals by accident; this plugin has no such rotation, so its finals were bare in every configuration. Pinned by `test_recent_games_get_odds.py`.
