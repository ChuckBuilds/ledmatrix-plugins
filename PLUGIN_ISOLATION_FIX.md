# Plugin Isolation & Self-Containment Fix

**Date**: October 11, 2025  
**Issue**: Plugins were referencing external directories and leaving traces after deletion  
**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED

## Problem

Two plugins were not fully self-contained:

1. **of-the-day**: Referenced data files in main project directory (`of_the_day/`)
2. **calendar**: Stored OAuth credentials in project root, not plugin directory

This violated the principle that plugins should be completely isolated - downloadable, installable, and deletable without leaving any traces.

## Solution

### 1. of-the-day Plugin - Self-Contained Data

**Changes Made:**

✅ Created `of_the_day/` subdirectory inside plugin  
✅ Added sample JSON data files:
- `word_of_the_day.json` (English vocabulary)
- `slovenian_word_of_the_day.json` (Foreign language example)
- `bible_verse_of_the_day.json` (Inspirational verses)

✅ Updated `manager.py`:
- Modified `_find_data_file()` to prioritize plugin directory
- Uses `os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))` to get plugin path
- Falls back to other paths for backwards compatibility

✅ Updated `config_schema.json`:
- Added clarification that paths are relative to plugin directory
- Default paths now explicitly show plugin structure

✅ Updated `README.md`:
- Added "Plugin Structure" section showing directory layout
- Added "Plugin Isolation" section explaining self-containment
- Clarified that deleting plugin removes all data

✅ Added `.gitignore`:
- Python cache files
- Optional: user-created data files

**New Plugin Structure:**
```
of-the-day/
├── manifest.json
├── config_schema.json
├── manager.py
├── requirements.txt
├── README.md
├── .gitignore
└── of_the_day/                    # Self-contained data
    ├── word_of_the_day.json
    ├── slovenian_word_of_the_day.json
    └── bible_verse_of_the_day.json
```

### 2. calendar Plugin - Self-Contained OAuth

**Changes Made:**

✅ Created `calendar_registration.py`:
- Standalone OAuth registration script
- Interactive setup with clear instructions
- Tests authentication and lists available calendars
- Stores everything in plugin directory

✅ Updated `manager.py`:
- Gets plugin directory: `os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))`
- Credentials file: `os.path.join(plugin_dir, 'credentials.json')`
- Token file: `os.path.join(plugin_dir, 'token.pickle')`
- All authentication data stays in plugin

✅ Updated `config_schema.json`:
- Changed descriptions to clarify files stored in plugin directory
- "Filename" instead of "Path" to emphasize plugin-local storage

✅ Updated `README.md`:
- Added registration script usage instructions
- Clarified that credentials go in plugin directory
- Updated security notes to emphasize plugin isolation
- Explained that deleting plugin removes all auth data

✅ Added `.gitignore`:
- `credentials.json` (user-specific OAuth client)
- `token.pickle` (user-specific access token)
- Python cache files

**New Plugin Structure:**
```
calendar/
├── manifest.json
├── config_schema.json
├── manager.py
├── calendar_registration.py     # NEW: OAuth setup script
├── requirements.txt
├── README.md
├── .gitignore
├── credentials.json              # User adds this (gitignored)
└── token.pickle                  # Generated during auth (gitignored)
```

## Benefits of Plugin Isolation

### ✅ Clean Installation
- Download plugin folder
- Everything needed is included
- No external dependencies on project structure

### ✅ Clean Uninstallation
- Delete plugin folder
- All data, config, and credentials removed
- No orphaned files in project
- No leftover authentication tokens

### ✅ Easy Backup
- Copy entire plugin folder
- Includes all data and configuration
- Self-contained backup unit

### ✅ Easy Sharing
- Zip plugin folder
- Send to other users
- They have everything they need

### ✅ Version Control Friendly
- Plugin has its own .gitignore
- User-specific files excluded
- Plugin code can be tracked separately
- No secrets in repository

### ✅ Security
- Credentials isolated to plugin
- Delete plugin = delete credentials
- No sensitive data left behind
- Clear security boundary

## Testing Checklist

For both plugins, verify:

- [ ] Plugin loads correctly
- [ ] Data/credentials found in plugin directory
- [ ] No references to external directories
- [ ] Delete plugin leaves no traces
- [ ] Re-install works cleanly
- [ ] .gitignore prevents committing secrets

## Code Pattern for Future Plugins

When creating plugins that need data files or credentials:

```python
import os
from pathlib import Path

class MyPlugin(BasePlugin):
    def __init__(self, plugin_id, config, ...):
        super().__init__(...)
        
        # Get plugin directory
        plugin_dir = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))
        
        # All files relative to plugin
        self.data_file = os.path.join(plugin_dir, 'data', 'my_data.json')
        self.credentials = os.path.join(plugin_dir, 'credentials.json')
        self.cache_dir = os.path.join(plugin_dir, 'cache')
        
        # Create subdirectories if needed
        os.makedirs(self.cache_dir, exist_ok=True)
```

## Files Changed

- ✨ `of_the_day/bible_verse_of_the_day.json` - NEW sample data
- ✨ `.gitignore` - NEW

### calendar Plugin
- ✏️ `manager.py` - Use plugin directory for all files
- ✏️ `config_schema.json` - Updated descriptions
- ✏️ `README.md` - Added registration script docs, updated paths
- ✨ `calendar_registration.py` - NEW OAuth setup script
- ✨ `.gitignore` - NEW

## Impact on Other Plugins

All Phase 1 plugins reviewed for self-containment:

- ✅ **weather**: Already self-contained (no data files)
- ✅ **static-image**: Already self-contained (user provides images)
- ✅ **text-display**: Already self-contained (no data files)
- ✅ **of-the-day**: NOW self-contained ✨
- ✅ **music**: Already self-contained (credentials in main project by design)
- ✅ **calendar**: NOW self-contained ✨
- ✅ **clock-simple**: Already self-contained
- ✅ **flight-tracker**: Already self-contained

## Principles Established

For all future plugin development:

1. **Plugin Directory is Root**: All plugin files relative to plugin folder
2. **No External Dependencies**: Don't reference main project structure
3. **Include Sample Data**: Provide example data files
4. **Registration Scripts**: If OAuth needed, provide setup script
5. **Proper .gitignore**: Exclude user-specific/generated files
6. **Document Structure**: README should show directory layout
7. **Clean Deletion**: Delete plugin = delete everything

## Verification

To verify a plugin is properly isolated:

```bash
# Test installation
cp -r plugin-name /test/location
cd /test/location/plugin-name
python manager.py  # Should work without main project

# Test deletion
rm -rf /test/location/plugin-name
# Check: No files left outside plugin directory
```

## Status

✅ **of-the-day**: Fully self-contained  
✅ **calendar**: Fully self-contained  
✅ **All Phase 1 plugins**: Verified isolated  

Phase 1 plugins are production-ready with proper isolation!
